                    <p>As it is your arrival day, take it easy after checking in to your hotel.  Grab some gelato and take a walk along the lakeside promenade.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Traditionally in Italy, locals get together with friends for an early evening cocktail called an aperitivo. In almost any piazza, you can sit and enjoy a spritz accompanied by local breads, meats and cheeses.
                        <br>
                        <br>

Wander the narrow streets and enjoy the sights and sounds from the local shops. In the center, you will find the 14th century Gothic Cathedral of Como and the 12th century Basilica of San Fedele.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Take some time in the afternoon to shop in Como. There are many boutiques and a weekly market on Saturdays around Port Torre.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the afternoon, we will head along the promenade to the right of Place Cavour and ride the funicular.
